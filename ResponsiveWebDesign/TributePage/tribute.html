            <h3 id="headline">About Claudia Gordon Deafness</h3>
           <p>She suddenly lost her sense of hearing at the age of eight.   At the time, she was in the care of her elder sister Mildred Taylor, a teacher.   
            She took her to a clinic as well as healers, to no avail.   The clinic nurse couldn't diagnose the pain in Gordon's middle ears, nor could the healers restore her hearing.  
             Her family was then forced to take her out of primary school for almost two years, since her school wasn't able to accommodate her needs as a deaf student.   She was kept at home to do chores instead.   
             Gordon later emigrated to South Bronx, New York. At age 11 she attended to Lexington School and Center for the Deaf in New York.</p>

                <cite>“By my junior year in high school, I made it known to all that I would go to law school and 
                    become an attorney. Many shrugged off my grand intention as wishful thinking. Some cited my 
                    deafness as an obstacle rendering it impractical if not impossible to pursue a law degree. 
                    Thanks to the values that were instilled in me during my formative years, I understood then 
                    that those voices of doubt neither dictated my worth nor my capacity. I want to contribute to 
                    a better society where there is more understanding and acceptance of people with disabilities 
                    and where the same opportunities are provided for all." - Gordon, Obama White House, 30 August 2010</cite>
